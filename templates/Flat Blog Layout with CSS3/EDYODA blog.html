                <p class="blog-description">Starting a career as a software developer obviously requires one to undertake a programming languages course that can cover everything from the basics to even the minute details. To learn a programming language though, one needs to also understand which one is suitable for you. Once your journey as a developer starts you will soon understand which language will be the most suited to you, your interests and career goals.
                    To understand which programming languages you should learn, you need to consider the following:
                    The kinds of projects you want to work on.
                    Whether you have a background in mathematics or logic.
                    Whether you are more inclined towards a higher-level language or a lower-level one.
                    As a web developer, what is your preferred choice, frontend or backend?

                <p class="blog-description">We’re rapidly moving towards a day and age where almost everything can be controlled by machines and one of the most revolutionary moves has been the advent of artificial intelligence. In this artificial intelligence course, we will talk about how to get started with AI and what exactly it is. While it began as a part of smartphones and other smart devices, AI has been increasingly taking over in other fields too. To begin with, one must understand what Artificial Intelligence is. It is an area of computer science focusing on the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.</p>

                <p class="blog-description">The process used by companies to convert raw data into useful information is called Data Mining. It is a process of searching, collecting, filtering and analyzing the data. A large amount of data can be retrieved from various websites and databases. It can be retrieved in the form of data relationships, correlations, and patterns. With the advent of computers, the internet, and large databases it is possible to collect large amounts of data. The data collected may be analyzed steadily and help identify relationships and find solutions to existing problems. Governments, private companies, large organizations, and all businesses are after a large volume of data collection for the purposes of business and research development. The data collected can be stored for future use.</p>

                <p class="blog-description">Innovation and us holds a bond that compliments each other. Digital transformations without cloud computing as its partner are like a half-built bridge. As it empowers us and helps in making progressive moves. One of the marquees in the digitally transforming technologies ecosystem is Cloud computing-An umbrella term that enables the users to accelerate and scale up the business using the cloud-based solutions.
                    Cloud is one of the key transformation enablers as executives are pushing their decisions majorly through the IT solutions. To learn cloud computing and shifting the processes digitally helps in reshaping business models and make their branding upscale in the competitive heats.

                <p class="blog-description">Python has been the most dominant programming language in the development community for quite a few years now. This is evident from the fact that according to a recent survey by JetBrains 27% of Budding Developers have either started learning python or they have studied it in the past year. Python has been voted ad top programming language of 2018 by IEEE. In a monthly ranking of popular programming languages publishing by TIOBE, Python is now 3 rd just behind Java and C. It has emerged as the go-to language for web development, data science application development, Machine learning and also applications related to Big Data. </p>

                <p class="blog-description">Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather and analyze information from the Internet.
                    Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet.
                    Rather than reading data from standard API responses, we’ll need to find the data ourselves by reading the website’s pages and feeds.
