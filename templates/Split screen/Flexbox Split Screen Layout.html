            <p>Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Quicken! Premiere! Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? Hahahahah! George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship.</p>
            <p>The Army had half a day. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. - Lucille Bluth. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where?</p>
            <p>Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC? Everybody dance NOW. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch.</p>
