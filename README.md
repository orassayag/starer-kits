# Starter Kits

Built in May 2020. React.js + Node.js starter kits for any purpose, basic kits, and more advances ones, including most powerful packages such as React.js, Node.js, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, React-Hooks, localStorage, Socket-io, SCSS, Express.js, Mongoose.js, and more. Great as boilerplate for job interviews.

## Templates

In the templates directory you can find great and basic examples for HTML and CSS snippets from [codepen](https://codepen.io/).

## Sources

for the following projects:
project-server-MONGO-database---client-hooks-redux-thunk
project-server-JSON-files---client-hooks-redux-thunk

You will need a local JSON file. They can be found in the Sources directory.
Inside of these projects, drop this "dist" directory into the server/src directory.
