02. If you find an update - update the package by writing 'npm i create-react-app@<version-number> -g' on the terminal.
03. After it finishes to update, do a backup to the client you want to update.
04. On VSCode, Create a new create-react-app app, on a temporary place.
05. After it finishes to create, exit the VSCode.
06. Enter it back again in the root of the project.
07. Eject the project by writing 'npm run eject' on the terminal.
09. Make sure that the project is working well by writing 'npm start' on the terminal.
10. Once it finishes - Go to the project and delete the .git directory.
11. Add all the eslint/README.md/gitignore files to the root of the project.
12. Restart the VSCode project.
13. Test that you see warnings on the 'problems' tab when going to see files on the path: scripts/build.js.
14. Copy the .vscode directory from the previous client to the new one.
15. Remove all warnings + duplicate empty lines + final empty lines on the following files:

-Change the name to 'client'
